# Examples

Welcome to the examples! The aim of these short snippets of code are to demonstrate some example usecases on how to use arc, and showcase the numerous features of the library.

## Running examples

To run and test the examples, simply insert your bot token in into the constructor of `hikari.GatewayBot(...)` by replacing the `...`, then run the example using the following command:

```sh
python example_name.py
```
